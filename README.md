# guerre

French, _noun_: War

A browser based version of the relatively brainless card game _War!_


## Development Environment
To set up your dev environment, you'll need to make sure you have the following tools:

### 1. Node.js (with NPM)
Check to see you have node by checking the version: `node -v`.  Use version > 6.0.0.

To install:
```
$ brew update
$ brew install node
```

### 3. Gulp
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a "streaming build system" that automates compilation and building your projects.
```
$ npm install --global gulp
```

### 4. Clone this repository
Pick your favorite directory and run:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aaronpanch/guerre.git
```

### 5. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the root of the project `cd guerre` and run:
```
$ npm install
```

## 6. Start the Server (last step!)
```
$ gulp serve
```
Your default browser should open to `localhost:9000` and you're ready to code!
